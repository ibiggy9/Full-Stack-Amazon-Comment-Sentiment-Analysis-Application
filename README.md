#Amazon Comments Sentiment Analysis Full Stack Web App

This is a full stack web app that can be found at:
https://dare-dih.netlify.app/

The function of the app is to enable the user to quickly search and assess the consumer sentiment of Dare and competitive products by:
1) Scraping all available Amazon comments on all available products in our categories.
2) Ingesting that into the cloud. 
3) Calling that cloud to a frontend that displays data.
4) Running a sentiment analysis model against all of the language in the comments to assess at-a-glance the consumer sentiment of the returned comments. 

There is a test account available for any who would like to preview the app:
